	<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="http://love-aesthetics.nl/">Love Aesthetics</a>
			</li>
			<p>
				<i>How does it exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				The site's openness, use of white as the central theme and "breathing room" of the balance of space and placement of various links reinforces the driving minimalist aesthetic of the author.
			</p>
		</ul>

		<ul> 
			<li>
				<a href="http://www.sacreddogs.com/">Victory Tischler-Blue's Photography Website</a>
			</li>
			<p>
				<i>
					How does it exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?
				</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				While the animation/video elements may take some time to load, the ethereal music and sort of interactive videos set up this really cool experiential immersion for the user. It's pretty basic - the links are simply on the top left corner - but the whole point is to showcase the photographer's eye which is very effective in terms of putting the art right up front.
			</p>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<strong>What makes them similar and different?
			</strong>
		</p>
		<p>Both sites incorporate the actual style aesthetics of the authors to reinforce the actual visual elements of the sites. The difference between Love Aesthetics and Tischler-Blue's sites are in the experience; while the former's site is more static and "observational" - click and see - Tischler-Blue's puts the visitor into the art experience with the video elements.

			<strong>Band website thumbnail</strong> 
		</p>
		<p>This is the basic layout of a simple, effective band webpage to concatenate all social media and other links into a master site. The focal point are the buttons in the middle - very "to the point" - and are superimposed on the image, which is probably going to either be a faded logo for the band or a press shot. The hierarchy is simple - the buttons are the main point. The buttons as the top left are sort of hovering above, maybe there's better placement but in general, a quick visit to the site shouldn't take a visitor more than 1 minute to find which button they're looking for. Very simple.</p>
