		<strong>About Me</strong>
	</h1>
	<p>I am a grants manager, living in NYC. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I would like to design a personal website and figured why pay for someone else to do it when I can do it myself with that money.</p>
	<h3>My Mission</h3>
	<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a freelance in something or another with cool clients and projects because I like to work with a cat in the same room, and there are very few cats allowed in offices, which is a shame I'd say.</p>
	<h3>My Experience</h3>
	<p>This is how I've evolved professionally:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Certification Specialist</strong>, GABA</li>
	<i>Tokyo, Japan (Aug 2007 - Oct 2008)</i>
	<p><li><strong>Clinical Research Coordinator</strong>, ADRC</li>
	<i>New York, NY (June 2009 - Jan 2010)</i></p>
	<li><strong>Grants Manager</strong>, ADRC</li>
	<i>New York, NY (Feb 2010 - present)</i>
</ul>
